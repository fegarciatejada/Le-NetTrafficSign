# Traffic Sign Classification Using Le-Net Architecture in Keras

## Step 0: Problem Statement

In this project, I aimmed to classify images of traffic signs using a deep learning model. The dataset contains images categorized into 43 different classes of traffic signs. The goal is to train a deep network, specifically using the Le-Net architecture, to accurately classify these images.

### Classes Include:

- (0, 'Speed limit (20km/h)') 
- (1, 'Speed limit (30km/h)')
- (2, 'Speed limit (50km/h)')
- ...
- (42, 'End of no passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons')

The network architecture is inspired by the Le-Net model presented by Yann LeCun. [Read more about Le-Net](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf).

## Import Libraries

To work with the project, the following Python libraries are used:

- `pickle` for loading and saving data
- `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for data statistical analysis
